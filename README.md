# Laba-2
Last time I was accused of plagiarism and copy-paste (Sadly, but fair).<br/>
This time, all (almost all) of the code has been rewritten / changed / revised / removed.<br/>
If you find something borrowed, please indicate the code fragment in which it was found (as it was left due to carelessness).<br/>
The basis (self-written / honestly pulled from OPEN Internet sources) remained almost intact.
